Hello! I'm Jo and I have absolutely no idea what to share about myself! I'm a mother and a lover, a student, a healer, a feeler, a thinker and a seeker. I'm a pretty humdrum human being. Your garden-variety dandelion. But, there's so much about me that I'm still trying to figure out. So much that's buried so deep, that I might not even know it exists. So much to do, so much to learn. 

So came the fruition of this project. Writing as vessel for self-discovery. Spilling my words onto paper as form of therapy. Taking my muddled mixed-up thoughts and putting them together like a jigsaw puzzle. Hoping that in sharing my writing openly I might find some clarity as to how I've come to be and where I might be able to take myself. A journey in appreciation for the workings of the mind. A catalyst for connection and creation and community. 

This space and these words are mine. They are symbolic of my strength and my undoing. They are raw and real and spoken from every curve and corner of my being. And, although I still battle with the thoughts that tell me I don't deserve to take up this space - I'm here and I'm in it. 

I hope that you take what you will from what I share. That in relation or disagreement, you find some sort of gift in my words.
