Hello! I'm Jonah and I have absolutely no idea what I should or could share about myself! 

I'm a mother and a lover, a student and a writer, a healer, a feeler, a thinker and a seeker. I'm a pretty humdrum human being. Your garden-variety dandelion. But, there's so much about me that I'm still trying to figure out. So much that's buried so deep, that I might not even know it exists. A lot to do and a lot to learn. 

So came the fruition of this project. Writing as vessel for self-discovery. Spilling my words onto paper as a form of therapy. Taking my muddled up, mixed-up thoughts and putting them together like a jigsaw puzzle. With the same trepidation and the same frustration. Translating all that I read in my books and hear in my conversations into something digestible. Hoping that, in sharing my writing openly, I might find some clarity as to how I've come to be and where I might be able to take myself. This is a journey in appreciation. Respect for the workings of the mind. A catalyst for connection and creation and community. This is my story.

Although I still battle with thoughts that tell me I don't deserve to take up this space - I'm here and I'm in it. I hope that you take what you will, from what I share. That in relation or disagreement, you find some sort of gift in my words. Some days, my words are all that I have left to give.
