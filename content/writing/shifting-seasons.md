This has all been part of my long, cold, desolate winter.

And this,

this is the part where it teases me.

Longer days and colder nights.

I let the vernal frost bite.

A renewed courage to endure its lingering sting.

It comes easily.

The courage to lean into the cold.

It comes easily.

Because I know what comes next.



My long, cold, desolate winter.

When life lays quiet, when stillness devours.

My restless limbs,

my racing thoughts,

the ache of waking up.

Your end is near.



The axis shifts.

The sun dances lazily through the sky.

Higher and Higher.

Its warmth sustains, dawdles into the nights.



My Spring is coming.

With its showers

and its flowers

With new beginnings

and hope.

And you.
