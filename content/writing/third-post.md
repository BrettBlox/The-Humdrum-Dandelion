Last week, I was asked what I would like to do on the perfect mother's day. If I could do anything, have anything, be with anyone - what would that day look like? My answer: I would like to sit in a quite, dark, empty room in complete silence for the entire day. Nothing to do or say. No obligations. Just me, myself, and I. 

I would like the impossible. Impossible even in a time when isolation is so readily available. 

It was interesting, the thoughts that came flooding into my mind and the sensations I experienced in my body, when those very words came hurling out of my mouth. My palms began to sweat. My shoulders tensed. Immediate guilt. Instantly surveying my surroundings for the next thing to check off on my never-ending to-do list. Shame for feeling that way. For craving a moment of loneliness. For silence.
