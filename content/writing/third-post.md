Last week, I was asked what I would like to do on the perfect mother's day. If I could do anything, have anything, be with anyone - what would that day look like? 

My answer was quite simple: I would like to sit in a quite, dark, empty room in complete silence for the entire day. Nothing to do or to say. No obligations. Just me, myself, and I. 

I would like the impossible. Impossible even in a time when isolation is so readily available. 

I found it telling, the thoughts that came flooding into my mind and the sensations I experienced in my body, when those very words came hurling out of my mouth. My palms began to sweat. My shoulders tensed. Immediate guilt. Instantly surveying my surroundings for the next thing to check off on my never-ending to-do list. For the next thing to add. I  am ashamed of feeling that way. Humiliated for craving a few, long moments of loneliness. For silence. For solitude. 

I feel so selfish for wanting that. Yeah. How selfish of me to want a day to myself. How selfish of me to want to celebrate my motherhood with the antithesis of mothering. How selfish of me for wanting to put down my full plate, wrap it in tinfoil, and set it in the fridge for another day. 

Selfishness. A word that hits me so deep. A label I was given so often, as a young girl struggling to find her way in the world. A name I've been called for loving the wrong way. I hear the word and I cringe at its meaning. A word whose intention is to divulge one's lack of consideration, one's self-interest. I hear that word and I want to scream. It's frustrating to give all of yourself to please others and to hear that you're doing it all wrong. That all your hard work and attention is being seen in a way
