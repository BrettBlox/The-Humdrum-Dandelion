<!--StartFragment--> 

It's not often that I find myself reaching for sleep. Most nights I very willingly let it take me. But, on this particular night, I was so consumed by my thoughts. Calignous notions wrapped up in brooding emotions. These words came to me on that night. A night when I couldn't keep the shadows at bay.

Itâ€™s scary

The stories my mind creates

In the night

Monsters

Lurking

In the shadows

Salient doom

Tension consumes

The chill

Of the unknown

It washes over me

My body freezes

My mind flees.

And then

I remember

I remember that i

Bubbling with ire

Toiling with pain

I am

The scariest thing

In this world.
