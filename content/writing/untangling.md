Wow. I don't even know how to start this piece. I mean, how do I casually bring up my divorce? Especially when it's something I've been avoiding talking about with most everyone for the past 9 months. Especially because it's painful and it's heartbreaking. Especially because it opens the door for sympathy and attention and judgment - all things I've not yet grown comfortable with receiving. 

Divorce - defined as to "legally dissolve one's marriage with (someone)." Such a sharp word. It's not a word that rolls gently off the tongue and it certainly feels strange typing it. It's as if one day, we just decided to take our marriage and plop it into a cup of water like an Alka Seltzer. Toss it in and watch it fizz away. Sip it all up and numb the hangover away. If only it were that straightforward. If only it were that simple.

The end of my marriage didn't come abruptly. It wasn't a surprise. It wasn't a text-message breakup or a clear parting of paths. It was years and years of trying and failing and forgiving and trying again. Years of talking it through or, a lot of times, not talking at all. Investing all of myself. Not wanting to let go. Not wanting to give up. Not being ready to. 

And, it's even more complicated than that because in my marriage, or any of my relationships for that matter, there is more than just me. My marriage consisted of two people. Two separate entities with two personalities, two sets of wants & need, two ways of moving through life. Two different lives that happened (and, chose) to get themselves tangled up in one another. Tangled up in the most beautifully tragic way. 

There is no one answer to why my marriage is ending. Except for maybe vaguely stating that **it's complicated**. It's hard to be asked that question, and to want to answer it, because I've asked myself that question a million times over the course of my marriage. Every single time, the answer has been different. Every single time, I told myself the answer wasn't good enough.

I think most people expect to hear that one of us had an affair or that one of us was living a secret life. Something dramatic, something abnormal. I've heard the rumors. I know the stories that have been created. It doesn't surprise me and I'm not offended. I'm fascinated by the human mind and its need to fill in the gaps. Its funny ways of doing that. But, it was none of those things that brought the end. I don't think it ever really is, in any ending of the marriage. I think those things are the visible symptoms of something much deeper. Something much more insidious.  

Over and over, I told myself I'd made a commitment to love this person, to be their partner in all things life. To show up, to back down, to make it work by any means possible. I took that commitment seriously. I took it seriously for ten years. A third of my lifetime. I loved fiercely and in all the different ways I knew how to love. I held on and I held tight. I promised myself that, for maybe the first time in my life, I'd see something through to the finish. Not for me, but for us. I gave it everything I could give. Maybe even more than that. He did, too. 

In a week, I'll be moving into a new house. A house that will no longer be **ours**. It's the first time in 10 years, I'll be moving without him. I'm not sure I even know how to do that anymore. It's terrifying, no matter how long I've been waiting to welcome this new type of space.
