Wow. I don't even know how to start this piece. I mean, how do I casually bring up my divorce? Especially when it's something I've been avoiding talking about with most everyone for the past 9 months. Especially because it's painful and it's heartbreaking. Especially because it opens the door for sympathy and attention and judgment - all things I've not yet grown comfortable with receiving. 

Divorce. To "legally dissolve one's marriage with (someone)." Such a sharp word. It's not a word that rolls gently off the tongue and I certainly feel strained typing it. Such a vague definition. Yet, almost mockingly frank. It's as if one day, we just decided to take our marriage and plop it into a cup of water like an Alka Seltzer. Toss it in and watch it fizz away. Sip it all up to numb the hangover away. If only it were that straightforward. If only it were that simple.

The end of my marriage didn't come abruptly. It wasn't a surprise. It wasn't an unceremonious text-message breakup or a clear and defined parting of the ways. It was years and years of trying and failing and forgiving. And, trying again. Years of talking it through and, a lot of times, not talking at all. Investing all of myself. Not wanting to let go. Not wanting to give up. Not being ready to. 

It's even more complicated than that because, in my marriage or any of my relationships for that matter, there is more than just me. My marriage consisted of two people. Two separate entities with two personalities, two sets of wants & need, two ways of moving through life, two different ways of loving, and two different ways of wanting to be loved. Two independent lives that happened (and, chose) to get themselves tangled up in one another. Tangled up in the most beautifully tragic way. 

There is no one answer to why my marriage is ending. Except for the vague assertion that **it's complicated**. That's true. It's complicated. Complicated, but explainable. It's a long story. A story that would require more than a few coffee dates and shared spliffs to paint a proper picture. It's really hard to be asked that question. It's even harder to muster the energy to answer it. It's hard because I've asked myself that question a million times over the course of my marriage and I've asked that question in a million different ways. **Why is this ending?** **Why isn't this working?** **How do I fix it?** **Can it be fixed?** Every single time, the answer has been different. Every single time, I told myself my reasons weren't good enough. I consistently told myself this, up until grew enough to know better.

I think most people expect to hear that one of us had an affair or that one of us was living a secret life. Something dramatic, something commonplace. I've heard the rumors. I know the stories that have been created. It doesn't surprise me and I'm not offended. In fact, I'm fascinated by the human mind and its need to fill in the gaps. The funny ways in which minds do just that, no exemption for my own. But, it was none of those things that brought the end. I don't think it ever really is, in any ending of a marriage. I think those things are the visible symptoms of something much deeper. Something much more insidious.  

Over and over, I told myself I'd made a commitment to love this person, to be their partner in all things life. To show up, to back down, to make it work by any means possible. I took that commitment seriously. I took it seriously for ten years. A third of my lifetime. I loved fiercely and in all the different ways I knew how to love. I held on and I held tight. I promised myself that maybe, for the first time in my life, I would see something through to the finish. Not for me, but for us. I gave it everything I could give. Maybe even more than that. He did, too. But, it wasn't enough to save something that couldn't be saved. And, that's okay.

I'm not leaving my marriage empty-hearted. I'm not leaving it at all. I'm letting it go. I'm setting free a part of my life that has been pulling away from me for a long time now. And, in letting it go, I am left with still so much. Ten years worth of good memories, painful lessons, self-discovery, love shared, obstacles overcome, humbling defeats, friendship rekindled, forgiveness and the sweetest little human I have every met. **All for not** does not exist in this story. My marriage was and my divorce is a gift.   

In a week, I will move into a new house. A house that will no longer be **ours**. For the first time in 10 years, I'll pack my things and move without him. I'm not sure I even know how to do that anymore. This feels new. I'm terrified, no matter how long I have been waiting to welcome this new type of space. We have lived together for so long. We have lived our lives, together, in the same space for a decade. We have lived our lives, separated, for the last nine months of that time. I've been waiting that long for this to happen and now it is.  

So begins the untangling. Or, so it continues.

I hope to continue sharing bits and pieces of this part of my journey, because I have seen how divorce is so often portrayed. I have witnessed how divorce is received as a human experience. I have had my own encounters with divorce. This isn't my first exposure. I lived through that of my own parents. I survived it. Divorce, de-enmeshing from your partner, is as real as it gets. It's messy and tender. It is also healing, transformative, and powerful. If you let it be.
