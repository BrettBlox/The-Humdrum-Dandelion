I've lived a cursed life. Mirrors shattered into a million jagged shards. Tiny reflections scattered about my cold, mottled feet. The silence echoes across this small room, overpowering the raven's gurgling croak. Her black, beady eyes tracing the river that bursts from my swollen, bloodshot eyes. Her spell wrapping its wings around me. Morphing. Constricting. Consuming.
