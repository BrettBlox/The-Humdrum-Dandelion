She lives a cursed life. 

Mirrors 
Shattered into a million clever shards. 
Tiny reflections 
Scattered about her cold, mottled feet. 
Spilling salt into her palms. 

The silence echoes, 
Bouncing between the four walls of this small room.

Overpowering the raven's gurgling croak. 
Its black, beady eyes 
Tracing the rill 
That bursts from her swollen, bloodshot eyes. 
Its hex wrapping its wings around her. 

Morphing. Constricting. Consuming. 

The stillness is nudged 
By the fisher cat's sorrowful yowl. 
Distant 
And, fleeting. 
She implores it to come closer. 
Or, for the wind to sing her its chilling lullaby. 
For her pain to find company. 

Anything to save her 
from being with herself. 

Her skin crawls, 
Her spirit frigid. 

This is the longest night. 
The solstice of the shadows.

She has been here before. 
The end of the world. 
Time and time again, 
Losing her way. 

Astray is the way of the seeker. 
Stumbling down this steep terrain. 
Spiraling into the void.
Unreachable.

If she makes it until sunrise, 
She will return here. 
She will come back to this place. 
Never searching for it, 
It will stalk her 
Until she is too tired 
And, too weak 
To outrun it. 

The nothing. 
The everything. 
Desolation.
Deluge. 
Her curse. 

There is one way out and it is through. 
Through the umbra. 
Through the anguish. 
To be devoured, 
And, burnt to ash. 

Her suffering is her companion. 
She lay herself down its arms. 
The sobs rock her to sleep. 

Not sleep, 
Numbness.

Hours, weeks, years. 
Later.

The rising sun's rays 
Do their mirthful dance across her cheek.
Her skin cracks under dried tears.
Her body aches, 
As warmth thaws her brumal sleep.

She lingers. She awakens. She goes on. 

Her curse,
her blessing.

Blessed are the cursed.
