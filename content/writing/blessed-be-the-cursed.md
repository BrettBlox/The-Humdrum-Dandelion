I live a cursed life. Mirrors shattered into a million jagged shards. Tiny reflections scattered about my cold, mottled feet. The silence echoes across this small room, overpowering the raven's gurgling croak. Her black, beady eyes tracing the rill that bursts from my swollen, bloodshot eyes. Her hex wrapping its wings around me. Morphing. Constricting. Consuming. 

The stillness is nudged by the fisher cat's sorrowful yowl. Distant and fleeting. I beseech it to come closer. Or, for the wind to sing me its chilling lullaby. For my pain to find company. Anything to save me from myself. 

My skin is crawling, my spirit frigid. 

This is the longest night. 

The solstice of the shadows.

I have been here before. The end of the world. Time and time again, I have lost my way. Stumbling down this steep terrain. Spiraling into the void unreachable.

If I make it until sunrise, I will return here. I will come back to this place. Never searching for it, it will stalk me until I'm too tired and too weak to outrun it. The nothing. The everything. The deepest depths of desolation. My curse. 

There is one way out and it is through. Through the umbra. Through the anguish. To be devoured and burnt to ash. 

My suffering is my companion. I lay down in her arms.
