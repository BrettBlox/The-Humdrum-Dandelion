There is this funky little disharmony in my thoughts. It has become more pronounced in the past few years - since becoming a mother, really. I often find myself caught between the longing to keep my child little and the desire to see into his future. My concept of time has shifted dramatically. Some days, I will it to slow down. I look at Silas and I don't recognize him for a split second. His limbs look longer, his imagination ever-growing and shifting, his movements more confident, more eager to exercise his will. I have these days where I watch him interact with his environment and I'm blown away at how quickly he learns and how much he's absorbed in his young life. I feel such sadness in these moments. A sadness that finds its roots in the knowing that these years are passing. The lingering pressure to soak up as much of this as I can before he can no longer fit so perfectly in my arms. Before he doesn't need me so much.
