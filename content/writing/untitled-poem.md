I thought I knew everything about her. I believed I understood her. I was sure I knew her favorite color and how she drinks her coffee in the morning. I thought I knew what she wanted to be when she grew up. I was convinced that she wanted to do great things. I assumed she was happy, happier than she had been in a long time. She was so sure of what she wanted. She wanted more. She was ready for the real world, or so I thought. She was so strong; I never worried about protecting her, keeping her safe. I thought I knew who she was. But, now, I sit here and look deep into her brown eyes and I can’t see any of that. All that I can see is what is lost. She does not know who she is; she does not know where she is.

It’s unnerving. She’s pitiable. But, she deserves no sympathy. She has brought this fog upon herself. She has become trapped in this hazy state on her own accord. How do I get her to pick herself up and move on? I want to shake her and tell her everything will be alright. I want to save her from herself. I try to blow the fog away and let the sunshine down on her cold skin. I try to pull her out of it, but she stands still as a stone.

I light a cigarette and deeply inhale her circumstance. Her sorrow fills my lungs. I feel the smoke seep into them, turning them black and hardening my heart. A bitter taste coats my mouth as I exhale. I become troubled. My stomach drops and a tear forms in the corner of my eye. I look up at her and see that she is crying. Her eyes are begging me to help her. I reach out my hand but she doesn’t put forward her own. I’m lost. Why can’t I ease her suffering? I can’t help her. I slowly turn away from the mirror, from her. I hesitate for a single breathe. I can hear my heart beating heavy and fast. I long to turn back and offer her another chance. I let the burning cigarette drop from my fingers; the ash catches the wind and drifts away. I take a deep breath and picture myself as a newborn gasping air for the very first time. I walk away from the cold, from her and her many troubles. I walk tall and I walk slowly, one step at a time, into the warmth, into tranquility.
