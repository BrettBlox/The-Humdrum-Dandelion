I thought I knew everything about her. I believed we had an understanding. I was sure I could name her favorite color and the way she drinks her coffee in the morning. She'd told me what she wanted to be when she grew up and her list of places to travel. I was convinced that she wanted to do big things. I assumed she was happy. She acted that way. At least, a lot happier than she had been in a long time. She seemed so sure of what she wanted. She wanted more. She wanted to make a difference. So confident, so sure of herself. She was so ready to taste life. To find her way in the world. So strong, I never worried about protecting her. I never stressed about keeping her safe. Or, so I thought. Now, I sit here and look deeply into her brown eyes and I can’t see any of that. I search for something. Anything. But, all that I can see is what is lost. 

It’s unnerving. Pitiable. I feel for her. But, she has summoned this ominous cloud. She has become trapped in this hazy state by her own volition. How do I get her to pick herself up and move on? I want to shake her and tell her everything will be alright. I want to save her. I try to blow the fog away and let the sunshine come down on her cold skin. I move to pull her out of the shadows, but she stands still as stone.

I light a cigarette and deeply inhale her circumstance. Her sorrow fills my lungs. I feel the smoke seep into them, turning them black and hardening my heart. A bitter taste coats my mouth as I exhale. I am troubled. My stomach drops and a tear forms in the corner of my eye. I look up at her and see that she is crying. Her eyes are begging me to help her. I reach out my hand but she doesn’t put forward her own. Why can’t I ease her suffering? Why can’t I help her. I slowly turn away from the reflection. 

I turn away from her, hesitating for only a single breathe. My heart beats heavy and fast. I long to turn back to her, to offer her another chance. I have to let her go. To live, I must. I let the burning cigarette drop from my fingers. The ash catches the wind and drifts away. I take a deep breath and picture myself at birth. A newborn gasping air for the very first time. I walk away from the cold, from her and her shadows. I walk tall and I walk slowly. One labored step at a time. Into the warmth. Into peace.

*I wrote this short piece almost 10 years ago. Back then I would've told you that I was at my rock bottom - the lowest of my lows. I was suffering. Life felt impossible. I wanted to give up, but I also deeply wanted to go on. I knew that I was a survivor but I didn't know if I could survive anymore. The truth was, I couldn't. I couldn't keep living the same way while making the same choices and still survive. This resurfaced as I began to scour my old writing for inspiration for the new stuff. I'm sharing it here now because I still relive this story, from time to time. Every time an old version of me dies its painful death, every time I sever a part of me that needs to be left behind, I feel the same grief. I feel the same sadness and determination, as I walk away. As I step forward.*
